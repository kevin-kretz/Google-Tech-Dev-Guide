# The Challenge

Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.
Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.
Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.
For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"
- The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
- The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
- The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.

## Learning Objectives
This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions.

## My Solution
I copmleted this program by solving this problem with on word in the set and a string on a piece of paper.  I knew I could make a brute force solution for this problem, but I wanted to make something slightly better by replicating how I would solve it in real life, even though this might not be the best solution.  I realized that part of my solution would involve being able to search only a subset of the string, because I have already searched it and I am not allowed to go backwords from the last letter I have found. I replicated this by saving the position of the last found letter, and then searching from the letter after that through the end of the string.
