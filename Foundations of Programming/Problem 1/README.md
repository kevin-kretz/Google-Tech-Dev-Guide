Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.
Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.
Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.
For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"
- The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
- The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
- The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.

## Learning Objectives
This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions.

## <a href="./first_solution.py">My first solution</a>
I copmleted this program by solving this problem with on word in the set and a string on a piece of paper.  I knew I could make a brute force solution for this problem, but I wanted to make something slightly better by replicating how I would solve it in real life, even though this might not be the best solution.  I realized that part of my solution would involve being able to search only a subset of the string, because I have already searched it and I am not allowed to go backwords from the last letter I have found. I replicated this by saving the position of the last found letter, and then searching from the letter after that through the end of the string.

## Google's Solutions
### <a href="./improved_greedy_approach.py">Improved Greedy Approach</a>
After, completing my solution, I returned and looked at Google's solutions.  I built them and studied all of the new topics I didn't understand.  Their first solution was a brute force solution, using a hash table.  My solution was better than this one, so I didn't build the brute force program.  Their next solution was a greedy approach.  I made this code and submitted it to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/">codereview.stackexchange.com</a>.  I recieved a lot of feed back, and made the improvements while learning about these new techniques.

Things I learned:
- The proper use of docstrings and dunders.
- The built in `defaultdict` function of Python
- Build better loops without using integers to index over things and how to use the `enumerate()` function
- Using lambda functions to sort objects
- How to improve my selection of default variables (e.g. I could have used `-1` instead of `None` for one of my default variables to eliminate a bunch of unnecessary code.)
- How to write better function and variable names
- Better use of classes
